Current Functionality:


Analyses/AnalysisPool: Linked with relational database and working correctly

Models: Linked to analyses, can upload with admin functions

Export Data: Currently not linked while I change it to accept new model parameters

Import Data: Works with CSV Files to upload models and analyses pools_list. Can now import data from contur directory

Runcards: Database is linked but need to make a few changes to HTML to show more data,
          and need to add in parameter file data

Result Storage: Functionality for MPTT implemented. Yoda2db script added which searches directory for yoda files and uploads to MTTP tree.
