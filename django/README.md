Current Functionality:


Analyses/AnalysisPool: Linked with relational database and working correctly

Models: Linked to analyses, can upload with admin functions

Export Data: Currently not linked while I change it to accept new model parameters

Import Data: Works with CSV Files to upload models and analyses pools_list

Runcards: Database is linked but need to make a few changes to HTML to show more data,
          and need to add in parameter file data
